##Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial

Developers write code, but they also write about code. Take a moment to search the web for tutorials about any of the subjects you’ve learned so far in this course. You’re likely to find thousands of tutorials written by developers of all skill levels, but especially by junior developers—like you!
This week's challenge is to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. 

The template used to create this tutorial is Regex Tutorial Starter Code
